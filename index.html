                        <h2>Elusive Sun Spotted in Scotland?</h2>
                        <p>With meteorological spring starting just a few weeks before, and March just coming to a close, no one expected to see soaring temperatures as high as 18 degrees Celsius so early in the year. It was dry, still, and warm for nearly a whole week in the last few days of March, seeing people all across Scotland dusting off their summer clothes and lighter layers. Unfortunately, the mid-July feeling was short-lived as the following Monday greeted us with light rain and grey skies.</p>
                        <p>Just a month on, as we approach the end of March, we are looking at another blissful glimpse of summer, with temperatures predicted to jump up to as high as 20 degrees. This weather is welcomed at a time when High School students are just finishing for study leave, hopefully, some sunshine can motivate them to get out and enjoy the warmth while they read up on important material.</p>

                        <p>With the increasing threat landscape, AI is becoming a cornerstone of cybersecurity. It can predict, detect, and respond to cyberattacks in real-time, offering faster, more efficient protection. By analyzing patterns in data, AI systems can recognize threats before they escalate and even automate defensive measures. As digital transformation grows, AI’s role in safeguarding our online environment is becoming more critical.</p>
