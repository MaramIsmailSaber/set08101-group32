Painted by Jonathan Yeo, the 8.5 by 6.5-foot artwork features the King in the red uniform of the Welsh Guards, set against a vibrant red background. A butterfly hovers near his right shoulder, symbolizing transformation and his accession to the throne. The portrait was commissioned by The Drapers’ Company to commemorate the King's 50 years as a member of the organization. The unveiling ceremony took place at Buckingham Palace, with both King Charles and Queen Camilla in attendance. The painting has since been displayed at Drapers' Hall in London.
