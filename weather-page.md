## Weather News Page Plan.
### Research
* reviewed a number other news websites to get a feel for what content to include, and for ideas on layout. Sites include:
* * https://www.bbc.co.uk/
* * https://news.sky.com/

* Not fully decied on how to implement a weather map yet, but i have found a few different libraries and other useful functions that may be helpful:

* * https://happycoding.io/tutorials/javascript/libraries/simple-weather-map
* * https://docs.maptiler.com/sdk-js/modules/weather/
  
### Inspiration
* for design we decided to steer away from modern news websites as we believe they all look the same, awfuly basic.
* as a result we chose to theme ours off of old-style NY times papers:

### Designs (Wireframes, Prototypes)
* design layout wireframe will be created using draw.io and added here upon completion

### Implementation plan
My plan for implementation will go as follows:
* initial focus on functionality and content, for example getting any javascript required up and running 
* will then proceed to work on formating and some style elements while keeping consistency with the rest of the site and staying true to the theme
* finally finishing touches such as adding elements other members have created that are needed for site consistency (nav bar, correct colours ect)

### Aditional features or ideas (To be Deliberated as a group at a later date)
