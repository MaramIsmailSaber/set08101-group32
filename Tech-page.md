## Tech News Page Plan
### Ideas & Research
* I have come up with some ideas for what my website page might include.
* JavaScript usage could be making the content images larger when mouse hovers over it.
* Shows latest tech new and breakthroughs with tech such as new GPUs, AI developments news related to that.
* Have different topics that can be filtered by topic tag.
* Have a support message function for asking questions.
* Have a video section on a ribbon in between the page.
* Have a subscribe button which opens a form to sign up to the tech page.
* Implement an image slide which shows different articles with their related image.

For the design we have decided to aim for a old style New York Times paper look and will try to replicate its fonts, design and layout:

These websites provided inspiration for the layout, features, and content structure I plan to implement.

### Design
* I will make a wireframe of my website using draw.io.


### Implementation
* The first step I will do would be making basic functionality like getting the HTML, CSS and the basic layout of the page working.
* Then I would add the CSS style to the website and add the functionality I will use with the JavaScript.
