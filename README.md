# **News Page**
### Roles:
- Maram: GitHub & backend; (I will help with all pages)
- Tala: Sports Page
- David B: Urgent news Page
- David A: Index/Home Page
- Jared: Weather/Forecast Page
  - We all have to demonstrate HTML and JS:
   `"Each member must be able to demonstrate use of HTML and JS in the feature/functionality they are responsible for."`
  - However we are allowed to delegate people in charge of both:
   `As long as every member of the group can demonstrate competence in front and back end work in both parts of the assessment, you can delegate the group in that manner.`
  - So I was thinking:
    - Maram & Jared: Backend (JS & databases, etc if we choose to implement them)
    - Tala, David A & David B: Frontend (HTML, CSS & general design)
      > This is just so that we can have all of us overseeing tasks so we can hold each other accountable.
