**Implementation Plan**
 
- I  plan on adding moving pictures on the bottom left corner 
- Adding ads with pictures of the players 
- the main recent breaking news will be put in a pic but when they click on it they get more detailed info on it 
- on the right side they can find the latest games and recent matches that were played by the certain sport they click on 
- the left side i plan on just putting random news of the sport
